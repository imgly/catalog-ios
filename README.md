# About PhotoEditor SDK & VideoEditor SDK for iOS

Our SDKs provide tools for adding photo and/or video editing capabilities to your iOS application with a big variety of filters that can be previewed in realtime. Unlike other apps that allow a live preview of filters, PhotoEditor SDK and VideoEditor SDK even provide a live preview when using high-resolution images and videos. The framework is written in Swift and allows for easy customization.
Additionally, we support adding stickers and text in a non-destructive manner, which means that you can change the position, size, scale and order at any given time, even after applying other effects or cropping the photo.

## How to run the catalog examples

The catalog project is preconfigured to use the Swift Package Manager to install [PhotoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/docs/pesdk/ios/introduction/getting_started/#swift-package-manager) and [VideoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/docs/vesdk/ios/introduction/getting_started/#swift-package-manager).

To get started open `Catalog.xcodeproj` with Xcode 13.3+ and run the project.
